    <p>Zoominâ€™ Rentals is a rental car business offering approximately 75 cars to their customers. The
        business has grown to over 5 locations with an average of 50 rentals per day, collectively. The
        level of volume they currently have and will have over time requires a database to keep track of
        the cars currently available for rent (and at which locations), the drivers registered to drive each
        rental car, and sales at each of their locations for logistical and financial purposes. They are
        anticipating the need for a database that is scalable alongside their business. The database will
        record Rentals of Cars out of the businesses Locations and the Drivers associated with those
        rentals.</p>
